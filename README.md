Project:= Student Management System
Tech Requirements:
Front End - React JS
Back End - Node JS
Database - Mongodb

learned about the  installation of mongo
*create mongodb account(singup)
*connect to mongodb account
    a)use tool to connect with mongodb
*studio 3T
*commands
    1)create Database
    2)create collection(table)
    3)create record into collection
    4)view record into collection 
    5)delete record into collection
*After deleting one it will change document 1 to 4
*CURD operations
*learned basic database operations:
CURD
1)create
2)update
3)read
4)delete
created student :id,name,dept,marks

NEXT moved on to the node.js
Done with setup vscode
And installing nodejs
And updated nodejs
And created HELLO WORLD program
file:c/:new file:new folder:node.jsproject|named project

CLI-CMD
GUI-tool(studio3T)
SERVER-nodejs
API-expressjs
MOCKCLIENT-postman
CLIENT-reactjs

Nodejs-is a frontend which is having sent http request and respone to node to VM(server)
output will be given in localhost:4000

And now checking on how to connect nodejs with  mongodb
studio3T is the tool to interact with Mongodb
Mongodb is the Database
npm install lodash
steps to connect:
1)mongodb-Install in local machine
2)mongodb-Start the server in local host,machine
3)mongodb-Working with local Database
4)mongodb-Working with the cloud Database
5)Mongodb-Connect mongodb with CLI(command-line interface) Example:CMDp prompt
6)Mongodb-Connect mongodb with GUI(graphical user interfacde)Example:Node.js
7)Mongodb-Connect mongodb with server Example:Express.js

npm i mongodb (install)
Started mongodb server in local:open programfiles/mongodb/server/6.0/bn/copyit/give right click with Git Bash it will connect
Connected with node js to server
 
 And inserted 3 records
 find documents
 updated one record
 And deleted one document
 And done  $gt,$gte,$lt,$lte,$eq,$ne,$in,$nin,and multiple conditions.

 Learned the Reading =
 Langague-Javascript:
1)const:is a single that the identifier wont be reassigned.Example:const x=12;
2)Let:use let when you know that value of variable 
     :Let allows to use declare variable.
3)var:is a function scoped.
4)Object:Is the a non-primitive data-type allows you to store multiple collection of data.
5)Nested Object:Are  the object that are inside another object/one object that contain another object.
6)Array:An array is the special variable which can hold more than a value. 
7)Popping And Pushing Array:popping is the out of items.
                            Pusing is the items that is into an array
8)Sorting The Array:method that sort an array alphabetically     


Working with mongodb updates

Setting up mongodb atlas
Connected studio 3T to mongodb atlas(cloud)
Connected mongodb with nodejs server


Learned :
1) API = API is a Application programming interface, Which is a software intermediary that allows two application to talk to each other
2)How the Client communicate with the Server = client and server communicates by Exchanging Individual Message (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.(json)
3) What is HTTP Protocol =  HyperText Transfer Protocol::is the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other over the Internet.
4) Types in HTTP protocol = POST,GET,PUT,DELETE.
a)POST:A post request is used to send data to the server
b)GET:A get method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI
c)PUT:A put method is a replace all current representations of the target resources with the upload content.
d)DELETE:remove all current representations of the target resources given by a URI

Communication between clients and servers is done by requests and responses:

A client (a browser) sends an HTTP request to the web
A web server receives the request
The server runs an application to process the request
The server returns an HTTP response (output) to the browser
The client (the browser) receives the response

Learned:How to download express,js
in console in vs code npm install express

Learned:How to install postman:
in web postman install
 And now after installing 
 connecting the database collection code to expressjs code and running in postman
 and checking output in studio3T

 also learned connecting nodejs to github Account 
 And also learnt source controll(pending changes)and commiting Messages
